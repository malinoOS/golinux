# golinux

golinux is a experimental init system and fallback shell for Linux. It's designed as the base of malino, which is why it doesn't have much, as all it does is init a few things, run a malino compiled output, and if malino crashes, then it executes a simple fallback shell.

Also the code is even worse than Source spaghetti and it sucks.
